# Security Policy

## Website Ownership

This website is created and maintained by **Buddhadeb Koner**. It is currently deployed on a free-tier server for testing purposes. Please be mindful of this when interacting with the website, as unnecessary or excessive requests may overwhelm the server's capacity.

## Server Capacity

Since this project is hosted on a free-tier server:
- The server has **limited resources** and may not handle high volumes of requests or intensive operations.
- Please **avoid making unnecessary or repetitive requests**, as they may cause the server to become unresponsive.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or vulnerability, please:
- Contact **[email@example.com]** with a detailed report of the issue.
- Include a clear description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and the potential impact.

## Security Practices

- We take care to secure sensitive data and maintain basic security hygiene.
- While this is a test deployment, all user data will be treated with respect and care.

## Final Note

This project is in the testing phase, and contributions or large-scale testing should be coordinated with the repository owner to avoid overloading the server. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
